# SimplePing-Java
A simple Java networking program that checks whether a given host (IP address or domain name) is reachable using the InetAddress class and displays the approximate round-trip time.

📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to check whether a host (website or IP address) is reachable using Java's InetAddress class.
The program takes a hostname or IP address as input and checks its connectivity status by sending a request using the isReachable() method.

Technologies Used
Java
java.net package
java.io package

⚙️ How It Works
Takes host name or IP address from the user
Converts the host name into an IP address
Uses isReachable(timeout) method
Measures round-trip time
Displays whether the host is reachable or not

▶️ How to Run the Program
Step 1: Compile
javac SimplePing.java

Step 2: Run
java SimplePing

Step 3: Enter Host

Example:

google.com

📊 Sample Output
Enter host name or IP address to ping: google.com

Pinging google.com [142.250.182.14]...

Host is reachable.
Approximate Round Trip Time: 45 ms
